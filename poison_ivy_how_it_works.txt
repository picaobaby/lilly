## Allergy Video 1: What is an Allergy?

an allergy is a
hypersensitivity response of the immune
system the immune system normally works
to defend us against disease-causing
germs and foreign substances that are
not a part of our body
however some people's immune cells
overreact to certain foreign substances
that are otherwise harmless any
substance that causes allergies is
referred to as an allergen allergies
have become a growing health concern
they affect about thirty to forty
percent of the world population and are
on the rise the rise is expected to
increase in the future as air pollution
and global warming increase note that
allergies are commonly confused with
irritations how do you tell which is
which
allergies involve the immune system
while irritations do not for example
lactose intolerance does not involve the
immune system and therefore it's not an
allergy rather it's caused by a
deficiency in lactose digesting enzymes
likewise a skin rash caused by abrasive
clothing does not involve the immune
system and is an irritation as well not
an allergy so how is an allergic
reaction triggered let's say there's a
bunch of pollen floating around in the
air or that you just ate a food you're
allergic to the allergens enter your
body through mucous membranes such as
the eyes nose and mouth inside the body
your immune system is on the lookout
when cells of the immune system
encounter foreign substances they are
stimulated to produce antibodies or
immunoglobulins proteins which recognize
foreign molecules
fine to them and mark them for
destruction in this case the foreign
substances are allergens the allergens
that entered into your body stimulate
immune cells to produce a specific type
of antibody IgE antibodies these IgE
antibodies dock on the surface of mast
cells a type of immune cell now the mast
cell is equipped to detect the allergen
and upon encounter the mast cell
releases histamine leukotriene and other
chemicals these chemicals cause itchy
eyes nasal congestion and other
trademark symptoms of an allergic
reaction what are some risk factors for
allergies well genes play an important
role if one of your parents has
allergies you have a 50% chance of
developing them and if both of your
parents have allergies you have a 70%
chance people with a genetic
predisposition to allergies will usually
experience more than one kind of allergy
in their life

under normal circumstances when an
individual encounter an allergen for the
first time the allergen would enter the
antigen-presenting cells or APCs 

these
APCs would then enter the lymphatic
system 

and when they meet T cells called
th zero cells these T cells would
transform into th one cell

the th1 cells would interact with
b-cells releasing several cytokines
including interleukin 12 interferon
gamma 

and the b-cells will be stimulated
to produce IgG antibodies 

IgG antibody
is a protective antibody and will not
result in an allergic reaction this is a
normal reaction 

cause of allergy 

in
patients who have an allergic tendency
when allergens enter the APC and the APC
enters the lymphatic system and interact
and activate th0 cells 

some th0 cells
would turn into th2 cells 

these th2
cells would interact with b-cells and
release cytokines including interleukin
4 interleukin 5 in interleukin 13
causing B cells to produce IgE
antibodies 

this IgE antibody response is
abnormal and is the basic cause of
allergy 

diseases caused by IgE include
logic rhinitis skin allergy asthma
insect allergy some drug allergies and
some food allergies 

excessive th2
activity would also suppress the
activity of th1 

and a strong th2
response would result in allergic
reactions

Allergy 3D Medical Animation


an allergy is an overreaction of the
immune system to a normally harmless
substance called an allergen,
common allergens include pollen animal
dander down feathers mites chemicals and
a variety of foods 

on first exposure the
inhaled allergen enters the mucous
membrane lining the nasal passages where
it is taken up by the antigen-presenting
cell which presents it to the t-cells

these t-cells activate the B cells to
release substances called IgE antibodies
against the allergen 

these IgE
antibodies sit on the surface of the
mast cells 

the mast cells have granules
containing chemical mediators like
histamine and prostaglandins etc on
exposure the allergen binds to the IgE
antibodies present on the mast cells
cross-linking them this results in the
release of histamine prostaglandins and
other mediators into the surrounding
tissue these mediators cause dilation of
the surrounding blood vessels and
increase their permeability this results
in the nasal stuffiness sneezing and
mucous discharge of allergic rhinitis
antihistamines work by blocking the
action of histamines at its receptors
and thus decreasing the body's reaction
to the allergen


============================




Poison Ivy, like its buddies
Poison Oak and Poison Sumac,

has an oil called urushiol.

When this oil touches your
skin, tiny chemicals creep in.

They're really small and your
body probably wouldn't think

much of them, but they
bind to skin proteins.

An inquiring cell with
octopus arms called langerhans,

or antigen-presenting cells,
APC, grabs the protein

with the Poison Ivy chemical

because now it thinks
the body is being invaded

by a foreign substance.

So it needs to send a signal.

The APC rushes from the skin
to organs called lymph nodes

to sound the alarm of
a pending invasion.

There, they meet up with T-cells
who are ready to help and expand

into an army that's prepared

to meet a Poison Ivy
urushiol invasion.

These T-cells move back to the
skin to watch for urushiol.

Some people, about 10 to
15%, seem to be resistent

to the allergic effects
of urushiol.

But even these people may
eventually develop the allergy.

If you're allergic, however,

the next time your T-cells
see the signal again,

they react by sprinkling out
proteins called cytokines

and chemokines, some of
which reach your bloodstream.

This causes a cascade of events,

leading to itchiness
and swelling.

They also recruit cells called
phagocytes, such as neutrophils

and macrophages, that
eat up and remove debris.

Cell assassins called
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes

and natural killer cells and
more helper and memory T-cells.

All of these cells send more
signals to draw more cells.

The overall effect is like a
faucet being turned on high.

The killers destroy the
urushiol-bound tissue,

but collateral damage occurs

and healthy cells
can also be killed.

Your skin turns red and blisters
fill with fluid as the deluge

of cell killers continues.

Your reaction will depend on how
susceptible you are to urushiol,

how much oil has
gotten into your skin,

and how much you've been exposed
to Poison Ivy in the past.

The chain of events is
complex, and it takes time.

In fact, it could be 48 hours
before you develop a itchy rash

and blisters.

If exposed, you can minimize
your allergic reaction

by scrubbing your skin with soap
and water as soon as possible.

Because it's an oil, urushiol
can get on your clothes, tools,

or pets and can touch
your skin later

with the same nasty effect.

So carefully wash those, too.

Of course, the best thing
is to avoid Poison Ivy, Oak,

or Sumac in the first place.
