Poison Ivy, like its buddies
Poison Oak and Poison Sumac,

has an oil called urushiol.

When this oil touches your
skin, tiny chemicals creep in.

They're really small and your
body probably wouldn't think

much of them, but they
bind to skin proteins.

An inquiring cell with
octopus arms called langerhans,

or antigen-presenting cells,
APC, grabs the protein

with the Poison Ivy chemical

because now it thinks
the body is being invaded

by a foreign substance.

So it needs to send a signal.

The APC rushes from the skin
to organs called lymph nodes

to sound the alarm of
a pending invasion.

There, they meet up with T-cells
who are ready to help and expand

into an army that's prepared

to meet a Poison Ivy
urushiol invasion.

These T-cells move back to the
skin to watch for urushiol.

Some people, about 10 to
15%, seem to be resistent

to the allergic effects
of urushiol.

But even these people may
eventually develop the allergy.

If you're allergic, however,

the next time your T-cells
see the signal again,

they react by sprinkling out
proteins called cytokines

and chemokines, some of
which reach your bloodstream.

This causes a cascade of events,

leading to itchiness
and swelling.

They also recruit cells called
phagocytes, such as neutrophils

and macrophages, that
eat up and remove debris.

Cell assassins called
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes

and natural killer cells and
more helper and memory T-cells.

All of these cells send more
signals to draw more cells.

The overall effect is like a
faucet being turned on high.

The killers destroy the
urushiol-bound tissue,

but collateral damage occurs

and healthy cells
can also be killed.

Your skin turns red and blisters
fill with fluid as the deluge

of cell killers continues.

Your reaction will depend on how
susceptible you are to urushiol,

how much oil has
gotten into your skin,

and how much you've been exposed
to Poison Ivy in the past.

The chain of events is
complex, and it takes time.

In fact, it could be 48 hours
before you develop a itchy rash

and blisters.

If exposed, you can minimize
your allergic reaction

by scrubbing your skin with soap
and water as soon as possible.

Because it's an oil, urushiol
can get on your clothes, tools,

or pets and can touch
your skin later

with the same nasty effect.

So carefully wash those, too.

Of course, the best thing
is to avoid Poison Ivy, Oak,

or Sumac in the first place.
