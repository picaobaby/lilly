
Allergy 3D Medical Animation


an allergy is an overreaction of the
immune system to a normally harmless
substance called an allergen
common allergens include pollen animal
dander down feathers mites chemicals and
a variety of foods on first exposure the
inhaled allergen enters the mucous
membrane lining the nasal passages where
it is taken up by the antigen-presenting
cell which presents it to the t-cells
these t-cells activate the B cells to
release substances called IgE antibodies
against the allergen these IgE
antibodies sit on the surface of the
mast cells the mast cells have granules
containing chemical mediators like
histamine and prostaglandins etc on
exposure the allergen binds to the IgE
antibodies present on the mast cells
cross-linking them this results in the
release of histamine prostaglandins and
other mediators into the surrounding
tissue these mediators cause dilation of
the surrounding blood vessels and
increase their permeability this results
in the nasal stuffiness sneezing and
mucous discharge of allergic rhinitis
antihistamines work by blocking the
action of histamines at its receptors
and thus decreasing the body's reaction
to the allergen


============================




Poison Ivy, like its buddies
Poison Oak and Poison Sumac,

has an oil called urushiol.

When this oil touches your
skin, tiny chemicals creep in.

They're really small and your
body probably wouldn't think

much of them, but they
bind to skin proteins.

An inquiring cell with
octopus arms called langerhans,

or antigen-presenting cells,
APC, grabs the protein

with the Poison Ivy chemical

because now it thinks
the body is being invaded

by a foreign substance.

So it needs to send a signal.

The APC rushes from the skin
to organs called lymph nodes

to sound the alarm of
a pending invasion.

There, they meet up with T-cells
who are ready to help and expand

into an army that's prepared

to meet a Poison Ivy
urushiol invasion.

These T-cells move back to the
skin to watch for urushiol.

Some people, about 10 to
15%, seem to be resistent

to the allergic effects
of urushiol.

But even these people may
eventually develop the allergy.

If you're allergic, however,

the next time your T-cells
see the signal again,

they react by sprinkling out
proteins called cytokines

and chemokines, some of
which reach your bloodstream.

This causes a cascade of events,

leading to itchiness
and swelling.

They also recruit cells called
phagocytes, such as neutrophils

and macrophages, that
eat up and remove debris.

Cell assassins called
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes

and natural killer cells and
more helper and memory T-cells.

All of these cells send more
signals to draw more cells.

The overall effect is like a
faucet being turned on high.

The killers destroy the
urushiol-bound tissue,

but collateral damage occurs

and healthy cells
can also be killed.

Your skin turns red and blisters
fill with fluid as the deluge

of cell killers continues.

Your reaction will depend on how
susceptible you are to urushiol,

how much oil has
gotten into your skin,

and how much you've been exposed
to Poison Ivy in the past.

The chain of events is
complex, and it takes time.

In fact, it could be 48 hours
before you develop a itchy rash

and blisters.

If exposed, you can minimize
your allergic reaction

by scrubbing your skin with soap
and water as soon as possible.

Because it's an oil, urushiol
can get on your clothes, tools,

or pets and can touch
your skin later

with the same nasty effect.

So carefully wash those, too.

Of course, the best thing
is to avoid Poison Ivy, Oak,

or Sumac in the first place.
